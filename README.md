<h1 align="center">Hi , I'm Tuan (Eli) Nguyen </h1>

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, specializing in computer vision. My research focuses on vehicle tracking, federated learning, sensor fusion and trajectory prediction.

## About Me

I am currently passionate about advancing the field of computer vision and applying my expertise to real-world problems. My key interests include:
- **Federated Learning**
- **Vision Language Models (VLM)**
- **Vision Foundation Models (VFM)**
- **3D Scene Understanding**
- **Autonomous Systems**

## Projects

### Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking
Developed and implemented real-time multi-camera vehicle tracking systems for various intersection scenarios using data from:
- Roadside cameras
- Fisheye cameras
- Fusion of camera and LiDAR data

### Federated Trajectory Prediction for VRU Safety
Designed a federated learning-based trajectory prediction algorithm to detect potential near-crash scenarios and ensure the safety of Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) like pedestrians, motorcyclists, and cyclists.

### Federated Learning for Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking 
Developed a privacy-preserving federated learning approach for multi-camera vehicle tracking, enabling decentralized training on distributed datasets.

### Parking Lot Management Application
Developed an application for real-time detection of available parking spaces using high-mounted cameras within parking lots, leveraging computer vision techniques to analyze camera footage.

### Traffic Video Analysis Application
Created an application for comprehensive traffic video analysis utilizing object segmentation, detection, and classification techniques to detect and classify various road users.
