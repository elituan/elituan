## Projects

### Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking
Developed and implemented real-time multi-camera vehicle tracking systems for various intersection scenarios using data from:
- Roadside cameras
- Fisheye cameras
- Fusion of camera and LiDAR data

### Federated Trajectory Prediction for VRU Safety
Designed a federated learning-based trajectory prediction algorithm to detect potential near-crash scenarios and ensure the safety of Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) like pedestrians, motorcyclists, and cyclists.

### Parking Lot Management Application
Developed an application for real-time detection of available parking spaces using high-mounted cameras within parking lots, leveraging computer vision techniques to analyze camera footage.

### Traffic Video Analysis Application
Created an application for comprehensive traffic video analysis utilizing object segmentation, detection, and classification techniques to detect and classify various road users.
